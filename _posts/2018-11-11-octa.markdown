## Background

<p>In computing, oracle (test) is a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed. The use of oracles involves comparing the outputs of the system under test for a test-case input.
Determining the correct output for a given input is known as the test oracle problem.</p>

<p>Oracles can be categorized in:</p> **Specified - Derived - Implicit - Human** as you can check <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6963470/">here</a>

<p>One of the problems is related a oracles in test case documents. In a determined context, testers were writting test case documents kind confused and this was causing some derived oracle problems, so I decided to built an classifier, using the company's project dataset to help testers write better test case documents, reducing the oracle problems and making easier to verify its behavior</p>
